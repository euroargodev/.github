**Euroargodev is a collaborative platform that allows code hosting, sharing and development, but also networking and discussion among the Argo users community and abroad.**

**History**  
Created in December 2019 for the Euro-Argo community to foster R&D and to provide a collaborative framework for the development and improvement of DMQC for Argo, the use of the platform has since then expanded.  
It currently hosts tools and materials related to Argo in general.

**Content**  
If you begins with Argo data, you can get started by visiting:
- the [Argo online school 🏫](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool)

To play with Argo data, use one of our hosted software:
- the [python library to fetch Argo data easily: argopy](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy)
- the [ArgoData.jl](https://github.com/euroargodev/ArgoData.jl) package to process and analyze Argo Data with [Julia](https://julialang.org)
- or the [Virtual Fleet software](https://github.com/euroargodev/VirtualFleet/)

If you're an Argo expert, you may also want to look at:
- the [Argo QC forum 📣](https://github.com/euroargodev/publicQCforum/issues)
- the [DMQC salinity calibration software: pyowc](https://github.com/euroargodev/argodmqc_owc)
- the [containerized Coriolis data processing chain for Argo floats](https://github.com/euroargodev/Coriolis-data-processing-chain-for-Argo-floats-container), [containers are available for download here](https://github.com/orgs/euroargodev/packages?tab=packages&q=data-processing).

📣 If you want to get involved with the **euroargodev** platform, visit the [development forum](https://github.com/euroargodev/euroargodev.github.io/discussions).

🌿 Note that we're concerned about the environmental impact of the digital Argo activities taking place on the **euroargodev** platform. [So, we're glad that Github claims to be carbon neutral](https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github). But starting June 1st 2024, we're experimenting with the [Green Metrics Tools](https://metrics.green-coding.io) from [Green Coding](https://www.green-coding.io/): an estimate of the energy used and CO2eq emitted by continuously integrated activities from **euroargodev** can be found on [this dashboard](https://metrics.green-coding.io/carbondb-lists.html?company_uuid=4f42f511-4d8d-4d30-9c5e-8490f2c68811).
